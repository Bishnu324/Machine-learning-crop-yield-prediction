## üß† Project Overview

This project focuses on **predicting crop yield** using multiple environmental and agricultural factors such as **rainfall, temperature, and pesticide usage**.  
The dataset, sourced from **Kaggle**, combines global agricultural statistics from various countries over multiple years.

The analysis includes:
- Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering and merging multiple datasets  
- Machine learning model building and evaluation  

The goal is to develop an accurate predictive model for understanding how environmental variables influence crop yield.

## üìä Key Steps Performed

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading & Exploration
Loaded four datasets:
- `yield.csv` ‚Üí Crop yield by country, year, and crop type  
- `rainfall.csv` ‚Üí Annual rainfall (mm/year)  
- `temp.csv` ‚Üí Average annual temperature  
- `pesticides.csv` ‚Üí Pesticide usage per country/year  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed duplicates & renamed columns for consistency  
- Converted non-numeric strings to numeric format using a custom logic  
- Filled missing values using:
  - **Rainfall:** Mean  
  - **Temperature:** Mean  
  - **Pesticides:** Zero (0)  

**Temperature dataset:**  
Sorted by `Country` & `Year`, filled missing values using `.ffill()` and `.bfill()` within each country group.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Quality Checks
- Verified there were **no missing or duplicate values**  
- Ensured all columns had correct numeric data types  
- Conducted descriptive statistical summaries

## üß≠ Exploratory Data Insights (Visualization Summary)

A detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was performed using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to identify relationships between features and yield performance.

### üîπ Key Visualizations
- **Country Distribution:** Count of data entries per country  
- **Crop Type Frequency:** Countplot showing most represented crops  
- **Rainfall vs Yield:** Scatter plot showing correlation between rainfall and yield  
- **Temperature vs Yield:** Line plot showing temperature influence on productivity  
- **Pesticide Trends:** Yearly bar plot of pesticide usage by country  
- **Correlation Heatmap:** Relationship between rainfall, temperature, pesticide use, and yield  
- **Yearly Trends:** Multi-line plot tracking rainfall, temperature, and yield variation over time  

### üîπ Key Findings
- üìà **Moderate rainfall and stable temperatures** positively affect crop yield  
- üå¶Ô∏è **Extreme weather fluctuations** reduce yield significantly  
- üß™ **Controlled pesticide use** leads to higher yield, but excessive use shows diminishing returns  
- üåç **Certain countries** show consistent yield growth due to better environmental and agricultural conditions

## ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Encoding & Scaling
- Encoded categorical features (`Area`, `Item`)  
- Applied scaling to numeric features for uniformity

## ü§ñ Model Training & Evaluation

Trained multiple regression models for yield prediction:

| Model | MSE | R¬≤ Score |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Linear Regression | 1.41e9 | 0.707 |
| Ridge Regression | 1.40e9 | 0.707 |
| Lasso Regression | 1.40e9 | 0.707 |
| KNeighbors Regressor | 1.54e8 | 0.967 |
| Decision Tree Regressor | **1.38e8** | **0.971** |

üèÜ **Best Model:** `DecisionTreeRegressor`  
- Achieved highest accuracy and the lowest MSE  
- Handles categorical data efficiently without explicit encoding  
- Robust to outliers and non-linear relationships  

---

## üîç Key Insights

- **Temperature and rainfall** are dominant predictors of yield variation.  
- **Decision Tree Regressor** performs best with minimal preprocessing.  
- **Rainfall & pesticide use** together show strong correlation with yield.  
- The dataset provides a solid foundation for future predictive agriculture modeling.

---

## üí° Recommendations

- Integrate **soil quality**, **farming practices**, and **economic indicators** for improved model accuracy.  
- Use **satellite and remote sensing data** for higher spatial precision.  
- Apply **time-series forecasting (ARIMA, LSTM)** for future yield trends.  
- Develop a **Power BI or Streamlit dashboard** for interactive visualization in future iterations.
